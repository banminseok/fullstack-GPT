      "Soju is a Korean distilled spirit. There isn’t a single universal “recipe,” because there are traditional versions and lots of modern variations. Here’s the basic idea:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Traditional approach (high level): ferment a starch source (most commonly rice, but barley, wheat, or other grains can be used) using a fermentation starter called nuruk (or yeast). The fermented mash is then distilled to concentrate the alcohol and, after distillation, diluted with water to reach about 16–25% ABV. Some brands filter or age it slightly; flavorings can be added in commercial versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Modern mass-market approach (high level): a neutral grain spirit is distilled and then diluted with water to the typical soju strength, often around 16–20% ABV, and sometimes sweetened or flavored in blends.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can’t provide step-by-step instructions for home distillation due to safety and legal concerns. If you’re curious about the process, I’m happy to go into more depth on nuruk, fermentation, and why distillation parameters matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Safe, home-friendly ways to enjoy or approximate soju at home:\n",
      "- If you want to drink something similar without distillation: buy a bottle of soju (or a neutral spirit like vodka) and dilute it to around 16–20% ABV with water. Add a little sugar syrup and a squeeze of citrus to mimic the mild sweetness and brightness.\n",
      "- Simple soju-style cocktail (no distillation):\n",
      "  - 2 oz neutral spirit (vodka or soju if you have it)\n",
      "  - 3–4 oz water (adjust to taste)\n",
      "  - 0.5 oz simple syrup (optional, for sweetness)\n",
      "  - 0.5 oz lemon or lime juice\n",
      "  - Ice\n",
      "  - Stir and enjoy\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’d like, tell me whether you want more background on the traditional methods, or a few more precise non-distilling cocktail ideas that capture a similar profile. \n",

      "Here’s a simple, reliable basic bread recipe you can bake in a loaf pan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basic white bread (1 loaf)\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients\n",
      "- 4 cups (500 g) bread flour (plus a little more for dusting)\n",
      "- 1 1/2 cups (360 ml) warm water (about 110°F/43°C)\n",
      "- 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (one packet)\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons sugar or honey (optional, helps browning and yeast)\n",
      "- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons olive oil or melted butter (optional, for softness)\n",
      "\n",
      "Steps\n",
      "1) Activate yeast: In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar/honey, and yeast. Let sit 5–10 minutes until foamy.\n",
      "2) Mix: In a large bowl, whisk flour and salt. Add the foamed yeast mixture and oil. Stir until a shaggy dough forms.\n",
      "3) Knead: Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic. (If using a stand mixer with a dough hook, mix on low about 6–7 minutes.)\n",
      "4) First rise: Lightly oil a clean bowl, place dough in it, cover, and let rise in a warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour.\n",
      "5) Shape and second rise: Gentle punch down, shape into a loaf, and place in a greased 9x5-inch loaf pan. Cover and let rise until puffy and about double, 30–45 minutes.\n",
      "6) Bake: Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake 25–30 minutes until the loaf is golden and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Internal temperature should be around 190–200°F (88–93°C).\n",
      "7) Cool: Remove from the pan and let cool on a rack at least 1 hour before slicing.\n",
      "\n",
      "No-knead option (very easy)\n",
      "- Mix 4 cups (500 g) flour, 1 1/2 cups warm water, 2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp instant yeast. Stir just until combined.\n",
      "- Cover and let rest 12–18 hours at room temperature.\n",
      "- Shape into a loaf and bake in a preheated Dutch oven at 450°F (230°C) for about 30–35 minutes with the lid on, then 10–15 minutes with the lid off to brown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips\n",
      "- Use bread flour for a stronger gluten structure and a lighter crumb.\n",
      "- If the crust browns too quickly, tent with foil during the last 10–15 minutes.\n",
      "- For whole wheat, substitute up to half the flour with whole wheat flour and add a tablespoon or two more water if needed.\n",
      "- Store loaf in a bread box or wrap well; freezes well for longer storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you like a gluten-free or whole-wheat version, or a faster no-knead method? \n",
