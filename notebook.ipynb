      "\n",
      " Tips\n",
      " - If you want a saucier version, add a splash of water and cook a bit longer.\n",
      " - For extra creaminess, add a spoon of yogurt at the end (optional).\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Simple Chicken Curry (quick weeknight curry)\n",
      " Serves: 4\n",
      "\n",

      " 5) If using, stir in cream or yogurt off the heat. Season with salt. Serve with rice or naan.\n",
      "\n",
      " Quick tips for all Indian cooking\n",
      " - Build a spice basics pantry: cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala. If you can, toast whole spices briefly in oil to release extra aroma.\n",
      " - Use aromatics: onion, garlic, ginger are your best friends for depth of flavor.\n",
      " - Balance with acidity: a little lemon juice or a toast of yogurt can brighten dishes.\n",
      " - Sides: basmati rice, naan, or roti, plus a simple cucumber-mint yogurt raita.\n",
