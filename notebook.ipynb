Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.\\n\\nThere are also many exoplanets — planets that orbit other stars. Thousands have been confirmed to date, and there could be billions of planets in the Milky Way alone, with potentially even more across the observable universe. If you want, I can list the eight planets or tell you about some interesting exoplanets.'"
